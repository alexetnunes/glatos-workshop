<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Receiver Efficiency Index</h1>

</div>


<p>The receiver efficiency index is number between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> indicating the amount of relative activity at each receiver compared to the entire set of receivers, regardless of positioning. The function takes a set detections and a deployment history of the receivers to create a context for the detections. Both the amount of unique tags and number of species are taken into consideration in the calculation.</p>
<p>The receiver efficiency index implement is implemented based on the paper Acoustic telemetry array evolution: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165783618302509?via%3Dihub">From species- and project-specific designs to large-scale, multispecies, cooperative networks</a>. Each receiverâ€™s index is calculated on the formula of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math inline">\(REI = \frac{T_r}{T_a} \times \frac{S_r}{S_a} \times \frac{DD_r}{DD_a} \times \frac{D_a}{D_r}\)</span></p>
<p>REI = Receiver Efficiency Index</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(T_r\)</span> = The number of tags detected on the receievr</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(T_a\)</span> = The number of tags detected across all receivers</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(S_r\)</span> = The number of species detected on the receiver</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(S_a\)</span> = The number of species detected across all receivers</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(DD_a\)</span> = The number of unique days with detections across all receivers</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(DD_r\)</span> = The number of unique days with detections on the receiver</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(D_a\)</span> = The number of days the array was active</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(D_r\)</span> = The number of days the receiver was active</p>

<p>We will import <code>dplyr</code>,<code>glatos</code> and <code>plotly</code> to run then visualize the REI.</p>

<h2>Running REI</h2>
<p><code>REI()</code> takes two arguments. The first is a dataframe of detections the detection timstamp, the station identifier, the species, and the tag identifier. The next is a dataframe of deployments for each station. The station name should match the stations in the detections. The deployments need to include a deployment date and recovery date or last download date. Details on the columns metnioned see the preparing data section.</p>

<h2>Plotting with Mapbox</h2>
<p>Mapbox is a Live Location Platform that can serve up map tiles for use. You can create a free account and get an access token <a href="https://mapbox.com">here</a>. Below we set the access token as an environment variable that <code>plotly</code> can call.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Sys.setenv(&#39;MAPBOX_TOKEN&#39; = &#39;Your Token Here&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>From there, we can just call the <code>plot_mapbox()</code> <a href="https://plot.ly/r/scattermapbox/">function</a> and pass whatever arguments we need for the map.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rei_mapbox &lt;- rei %&gt;% 
  plot_mapbox(lat = ~latitude, lon = ~longitude, color = ~rei , width=900) %&gt;%
  add_markers(
    text = ~paste(station, &#39;:&#39;, rei), 
    hoverinfo = &quot;text&quot;,
    size = ~c(rei*6 +10)
  )%&gt;%
  layout(title = &quot;REI Mapbox&quot;, 
    mapbox = list(zoom = 5,
                        center = list(lat = ~median(latitude),
                                      lon = ~median(longitude))
  ))</code></pre>
<p>To show the map you can just type out the variable name.</p>
